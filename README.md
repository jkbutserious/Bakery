# Pierre's Bakery

#### C# TDD Weekly Project for Epicodus, 7.17.2020

#### By Jeff Kim

## Description

Pierre is a simple, hardworking man. He learned to make le pain (bread) and les patisseries from his father. As luck would have it, he has recently become engaged to the wealthy heirress of a well-known flour empire, which will cut his costs considerably, and he wants to pass the savings on to you, the customer!

This exercise is part of a take-home technical challenge that will demonstrate Jeff's skills in C# development. The end product is a console app that will allow users to input the number of bread and pastries they want and display the total price of their order, along with their discount savings.

## Specs

| Behavior    | Sample Input | Sample Output |

| Program will prompt users to press the 'P' key to add a pastry to their cart | 'P' | "1 pastry" |
| Program will calculate the price of an order based on the number of pastries and loaves of bread | 2, 3 | "Total: $16" |
| Program will apply discounts to orders for bread: buy 2 get 1 free | 3, 3 | Total: $16 |
| Program will apply discounts to orders for pastries: buy 1 for $2, or 3 for $5 | 3, 3 | $15 |
